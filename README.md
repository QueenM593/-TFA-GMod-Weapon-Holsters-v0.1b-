# -TFA-GMod-Weapon-Holsters-v0.1b-

Hello and welcome to the TFA GWH Project! We aim to provide weapon holstering support to all weapons of popular importance currently on the TFA Base.
If you would like to help feel free to fork the project and start working on weapons we currently do not already support. If you are new to git
feel free to read this somewhat helpful guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o599ftTRcHWWmDRIibNfC5NcJJF1YTY9IizqnxzgM7U/edit?usp=sharing
