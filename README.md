# [TFA] Weapon Holstering Repository

Hello and welcome to the TFA WH Project! We aim to provide weapon holstering support to all weapons of popular importance currently on the TFA Base.
If you would like to contribute your own work, add support for your own weapons, or add support for your favorite pack feel free to fork the project and start working on weapons we currently do not already support. If you are new to git
feel free to read this somewhat helpful guide here:
